This is the SubGraphs for the GSD contracts on rinkeby.

Each contract has its subgraph project.
All of the subgraph projects are created by the whole steps on subgraph studio. 
And except for the deploy step, the whole steps(graph codegen && graph build) are completed.

4 contracts of them( bondCalculator, stakingWarmup, TraderJoe_avalanche, TraderJoe_rinkeby) are successfully deployed.

When I deploy subgraphs on studio, this error is usually shown.
Failed to deploy to Graph node https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/: subgraph resolve error: resolve error: Serialization error: missing field `name` at line 106 column 3
